## Team Contract (acc11-amallik2-rustomi2)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week in Ayan and Rustom's room. 
We are close in residential spatial proximity, so we will use discretion on maintaining meeting times and meet in person. 

2. **Assistance** 
Each team member can be contacted through email ({acc11, amallik2, rustomi2}@illinois.edu), Discord, or by knocking on the door. 
Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to door-knocks within 24 hours.
3. **Respect** 
We will all respect one another's agency and make sure that all decisions are made unanimously. If we are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a member of the CS 225 staff. We are friends going into this project, so we will get along just fine.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** 
We will determine work distribution on a case-by-case basis. As great friends, we will ensure to treat each other's time with the utmost respect. 
2. **Time Commitment** 
Each member is expected to work no less than 1 and no more than 48 hours per week on the project. 
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should apologize in written form be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** 
All conflicts within the team will be decided by an arm-wrestle, or a typing speed test if necessary.
